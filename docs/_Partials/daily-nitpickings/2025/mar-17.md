#### Tiny pointers (data structure)

Came across a very interesting [article in Wired](https://apple.news/AEHw3o1tvRwyH0raYxoL7lw) that points to the following paper on arXiv: [*Optimal Bounds for Open Addressing Without Reordering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305). From the abstract:

> In this paper, we revisit one of the simplest problems in data structures: the task of inserting elements into an open-addressed hash table so that elements can later be retrieved with as few probes as possible. We show that, even without reordering elements over time, it is possible to construct a hash table that achieves far better expected search complexities (both amortized and worst-case) than were previously thought possible. Along the way, we disprove the central conjecture left by Yao in his seminal paper "Uniform Hashing is Optimal". All of our results come with matching lower bounds.

It would be good to revisit the Wired article and linked academic papers when possible.
