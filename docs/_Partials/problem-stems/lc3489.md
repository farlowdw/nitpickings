You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>, val<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

Each `queries[i]` represents the following action on `nums`:

- Select a subset of indices in the range <code>[l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> from `nums`.
- Decrement the value at each selected index by exactly <code>val<sub>i</sub></code>.

A **Zero Array** is an array with all its elements equal to `0`.

Return the minimum possible non-negative value of `k`, such that after processing the first `k` queries in sequence, `nums` becomes a Zero Array. If no such `k` exists, return `-1`.
