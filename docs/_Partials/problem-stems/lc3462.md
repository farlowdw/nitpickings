You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n x m`, an integer array `limits` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. The task is to find the maximum sum of at most `k` elements from the matrix `grid` such that:

- The number of elements taken from the `i`th row of `grid` does not exceed `limits[i]`.

Return the maximum sum.
