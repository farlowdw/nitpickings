You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

An integer `x` is almost missing from `nums` if `x` appears in exactly one subarray of size `k` within `nums`.

Return the largest almost missing integer from `nums`. If no such integer exists, return `-1`.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
