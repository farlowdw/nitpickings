You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Remove any pair of adjacent characters in the string that are consecutive in the alphabet, in either order (e.g., `'a'` and `'b'`, or `'b'` and `'a'`).
- Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after performing the operations optimally.

Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` and `'z'` are consecutive.
