You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

For each contiguous subarray of length `k`, determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that must be sorted so that the entire window becomes non‑decreasing; if the window is already sorted, its required length is zero.

Return an array of length `n − k + 1` where each element corresponds to the answer for its window.
