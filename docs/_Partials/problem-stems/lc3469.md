You are given an integer array `nums`. Your task is to remove **all elements** from the array by performing one of the following operations at each step until `nums` is empty:

- Choose any two elements from the first three elements of `nums` and remove them. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the two elements removed.
- If fewer than three elements remain in `nums`, remove all the remaining elements in a single operation. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the remaining elements.

Return the minimum cost required to remove all the elements.
