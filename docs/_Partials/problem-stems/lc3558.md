There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, rooted at node `1`. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

Initially, all edges have a weight of `0`. You must assign each edge a weight of either `1` or `2`.

The cost of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

Select any one node `x` at the maximum depth. Return the number of ways to assign edge weights in the path from node `1` to `x` such that its total cost is odd.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

Note: Ignore all edges not in the path from node `1` to `x`.
