You are given a positive integer `n`, representing an `n x n` city. You are also given a 2D grid `buildings`, where `buildings[i] = [x, y]` denotes a unique building located at coordinates `[x, y]`.

A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.
