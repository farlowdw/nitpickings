You are given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.

A string `word` of length `n + m - 1` is defined to be generated by `str1` and `str2` if it satisfies the following conditions for each index `0 <= i <= n - 1`:

- If `str1[i] == 'T'`, the substring of `word` with size `m` starting at index `i` is equal to `str2`, i.e., `word[i..(i + m - 1)] == str2`.
- If `str1[i] == 'F'`, the substring of `word` with size `m` starting at index `i` is not equal to `str2`, i.e., `word[i..(i + m - 1)] != str2`.

Return the lexicographically smallest possible string that can be generated by `str1` and `str2`. If no string can be generated, return an empty string `""`.
