You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n` sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `maxDiff`.

An undirected edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is at most `maxDiff` (i.e., `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff`).

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each <code>queries[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code>, determine whether there exists a path between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is true if there exists a path between <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the `i`th query and `false` otherwise.
