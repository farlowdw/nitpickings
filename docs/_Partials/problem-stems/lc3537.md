You are given a non-negative integer `n` representing a <code>2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup></code> grid. You must fill the grid with integers from `0` to <code>2<sup>2n</sup> - 1</code> to make it special. A grid is special if it satisfies all the following conditions:

- All numbers in the top-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-right quadrant.
- All numbers in the bottom-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-left quadrant.
- All numbers in the bottom-left quadrant are smaller than those in the top-left quadrant.
- Each of its quadrants is also a special grid.

Return the special <code>2<sup>n</sup> x 2<sup>n</sup></code> grid.
