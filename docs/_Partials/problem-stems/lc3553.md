You are given an undirected weighted tree with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and v<sub>i</sub> with weight w<sub>i</sub>.â€‹

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `queries`, where <code>queries[j] = [src1<sub>j</sub>, src2<sub>j</sub>, dest<sub>j</sub>]</code>.

Return an array `answer` of length equal to `queries.length`, where `answer[j]` is the minimum total weight of a subtree such that it is possible to reach <code>dest<sub>j</sub></code> from both <code>src1<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>src2<sub>j</sub></code> using edges in this subtree.

A subtree here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.
