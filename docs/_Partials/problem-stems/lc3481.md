You are given a `replacements` mapping and a `text` string that may contain placeholders formatted as `%var%`, where each `var` corresponds to a key in the `replacements` mapping. Each replacement value may itself contain one or more such placeholders. Each placeholder is replaced by the value associated with its corresponding replacement key.

Return the fully substituted `text` string which does not contain any placeholders.
