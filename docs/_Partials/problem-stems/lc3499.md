You are given a binary string `s` of length `n`, where:

- `'1'` represents an active section.
- `'0'` represents an inactive section.

You can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in `s`. In a trade, you:

- Convert a contiguous block of `'1'`s that is surrounded by '0's to all '0's.
- Afterward, convert a contiguous block of `'0'`s that is surrounded by `'1'`s to all `'1'`s.

Return the maximum number of active sections in `s` after making the optimal trade.

**Note:** Treat `s` as if it is augmented with a `'1'` at both ends, forming `t = '1' + s + '1'`. The augmented `'1'`s do not contribute to the final count.
