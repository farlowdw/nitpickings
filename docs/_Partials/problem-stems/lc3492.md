You are given a positive integer `n` representing an `n x n` cargo deck on a ship. Each cell on the deck can hold one container with a weight of exactly `w`.

However, the total weight of all containers, if loaded onto the deck, must not exceed the ship's maximum weight capacity, `maxWeight`.

Return the maximum number of containers that can be loaded onto the ship.
