You are given a 2D integer array `properties` having dimensions `n x m` and an integer `k`.

Define a function `intersect(a, b)` that returns the number of distinct integers common to both arrays `a` and `b`.

Construct an undirected graph where each index `i` corresponds to `properties[i]`. There is an edge between node `i` and node `j` if and only if `intersect(properties[i], properties[j]) >= k`, where `i` and `j` are in the range `[0, n - 1]` and `i != j`.

Return the number of connected components in the resulting graph.
