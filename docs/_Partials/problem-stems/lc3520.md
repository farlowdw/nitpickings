You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.

An inversion pair with a threshold `x` is defined as a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

- `i < j`
- `nums[i] > nums[j]`
- The difference between the two numbers is at most `x` (i.e. `nums[i] - nums[j] <= x`).

Your task is to determine the minimum integer `min_threshold` such that there are at least `k` inversion pairs with threshold `min_threshold`.

If no such integer exists, return `-1`.
