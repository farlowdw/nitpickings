Given two integers, `n` and `k`, an alternating permutation is a permutation of the first n positive integers such that no two adjacent elements are both odd or both even.

Return the `k`-th alternating permutation sorted in lexicographical order. If there are fewer than `k` valid alternating permutations, return an empty list.
