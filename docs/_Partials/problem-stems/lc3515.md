You are given an integer `n` and an undirected, weighted tree rooted at node `1` with `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates an undirected edge from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `q`, where each `queries[i]` is either:

- `[1, u, v, w']` &#8212; Update the weight of the edge between nodes `u` and `v` to `w'`, where `(u, v)` is guaranteed to be an edge present in `edges`.
- `[2, x]` &#8212; Compute the shortest path distance from the root node `1` to node `x`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the shortest path distance from node `1` to `x` for the `i`th query of `[2, x]`.
