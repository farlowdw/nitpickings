You are given two integer arrays `forward` and `backward`, both of size `n`. You are also given another integer array `queries`.

There are `n` houses arranged in a circle. The houses are connected via roads in a special arrangement:

- For all `0 <= i <= n - 2`, house `i` is connected to house `i + 1` via a road with length `forward[i]` meters. Additionally, house `n - 1` is connected back to house `0` via a road with length `forward[n - 1]` meters, completing the circle.
- For all `1 <= i <= n - 1`, house `i` is connected to house `i - 1` via a road with length `backward[i]` meters. Additionally, house `0` is connected back to house `n - 1` via a road with length `backward[0]` meters, completing the circle.

You can walk at a pace of one meter per second. Starting from house 0, find the minimum time taken to visit each house in the order specified by `queries`.

Return the minimum total time taken to visit the houses.
