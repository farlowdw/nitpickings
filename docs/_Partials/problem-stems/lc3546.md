You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

- Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
- The sum of the elements in both sections is equal.

Return `true` if such a partition exists; otherwise return `false`.
