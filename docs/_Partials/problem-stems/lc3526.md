You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D integer array `queries` of length `q`, where each query is one of the following three types:

1. Update: `queries[i] = [1, index, value]`

    Set `nums[index] = value`.

2. Range XOR Query: `queries[i] = [2, left, right]`

    Compute the bitwise XOR of all elements in the subarray `nums[left...right]`, and record this result.

3. Reverse Subarray: `queries[i] = [3, left, right]`

    Reverse the subarray `nums[left...right]` in place.

Return an array of the results of all range XOR queries in the order they were encountered.
