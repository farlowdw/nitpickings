You are given a circular array `nums` and an array `queries`.

For each query `i`, you have to find the following:

- The minimum distance between the element at index `queries[i]` and any other index `j` in the circular array, where `nums[j] == nums[queries[i]]`. If no such index exists, the answer for that query should be `-1`.

Return an array `answer` of the same size as `queries`, where `answer[i]` represents the result for query `i`.
