Given a string `s`, calculate its reverse degree.

The reverse degree is calculated as follows:

1. For each character, multiply its position in the reversed alphabet (`'a' = 26`, `'b' = 25`, ..., `'z' = 1`) with its position in the string (1-indexed).
2. Sum these products for all characters in the string.

Return the reverse degree of `s`.
