There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, rooted at node `1`. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

Initially, all edges have a weight of `0`. You must assign each edge a weight of either `1` or `2`.

The cost of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each <code>queries[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code>, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges in the path such that the cost of the path between <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> is odd.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code> to each `answer[i]`.

Note: For each query, disregard all edges not in the path between node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.
