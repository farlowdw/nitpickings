A spreadsheet is a grid with 26 columns (labeled from `'A'` to `'Z'`) and a given number of rows. Each cell in the spreadsheet can hold an integer value between `0` and `105`.

Implement the `Spreadsheet` class:

- `Spreadsheet(int rows)` Initializes a spreadsheet with 26 columns (labeled `'A'` to `'Z'`) and the specified number of rows. All cells are initially set to `0`.
- `void setCell(String cell, int value)` Sets the value of the specified `cell`. The cell reference is provided in the format `"AX"` (e.g., `"A1"`, `"B10"`), where the letter represents the column (from `'A'` to `'Z'`) and the number represents a 1-indexed row.
- `void resetCell(String cell)` Resets the specified cell to `0`.
- `int getValue(String formula)` Evaluates a formula of the form `"=X+Y"`, where `X` and `Y` are either cell references or non-negative integers, and returns the computed sum.

**Note:** If `getValue` references a cell that has not been explicitly set using `setCell`, its value is considered `0`.
