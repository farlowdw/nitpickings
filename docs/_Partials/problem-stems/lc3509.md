You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers, `k` and `limit`. Your task is to find a non-empty subsequence of `nums` that:

- Has an alternating sum equal to `k`.
- Maximizes the product of all its numbers without the product exceeding `limit`.

Return the product of the numbers in such a subsequence. If no subsequence satisfies the requirements, return `-1`.

The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.
