You are given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`.

For each index `i` in the range `[0, words.length - 1]`, find the length of the longest common prefix among any `k` strings (selected at distinct indices) from the remaining array after removing the `i`th element.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the answer for `i`th element. If removing the `i`th element leaves the array with fewer than `k` strings, `answer[i]` is `0`.
