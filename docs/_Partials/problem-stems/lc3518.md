You are given a palindromic string `s` and an integer `k`.

Return the `k`th lexicographically smallest palindromic permutation of `s`. If there are fewer than `k` distinct palindromic permutations, return an empty string.

Note: Different rearrangements that yield the same palindromic string are considered identical and are counted once.
