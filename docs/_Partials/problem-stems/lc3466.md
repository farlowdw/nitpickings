Mario drives on a two-lane freeway with coins every mile. You are given two integer arrays, `lane1` and `lane2`, where the value at the `i`th index represents the number of coins he *gains* or *loses* in the `i`th mile in that lane.

- If Mario is in lane `1` at mile `i` and `lane1[i] > 0`, Mario gains `lane1[i]` coins.
- If Mario is in lane `1` at mile `i` and `lane1[i] < 0`, Mario pays a toll and loses `abs(lane1[i])` coins.
- The same rules apply for `lane2`.

Mario can enter the freeway anywhere and exit anytime after traveling **at least** one mile. Mario always enters the freeway on lane 1 but can switch lanes **at most** 2 times.

A **lane switch** is when Mario goes from lane 1 to lane 2 or vice versa.

Return the maximum number of coins Mario can earn after performing **at most 2 lane switches**.

**Note:** Mario can switch lanes immediately upon entering or just before exiting the freeway.
