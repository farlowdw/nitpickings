You are given an integer `n` and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges`, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates a directed edge from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.

You are also given two integers, `k` and `t`.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of edge weights for any path in the graph such that:

- The path contains exactly `k` edges.
- The total sum of edge weights in the path is strictly less than `t`.

Return the maximum possible sum of weights for such a path. If no such path exists, return `-1`.
