You are given an array of positive integers `nums`, and a positive integer `k`.

You are allowed to perform an operation once on `nums`, where in each operation you can remove any non-overlapping prefix and suffix from `nums` such that `nums` remains non-empty.

You need to find the x-value of `nums`, which is the number of ways to perform this operation so that the product of the remaining elements leaves a remainder of `x` when divided by `k`.

Return an array `result` of size `k` where `result[x]` is the x-value of `nums` for `0 <= x <= k - 1`.

A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

A suffix of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array.

Note that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be empty.
