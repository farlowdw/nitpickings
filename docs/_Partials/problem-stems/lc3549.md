You are given two integer arrays `poly1` and `poly2`, where the element at index `i` in each array represents the coefficient of <code>x<sup>i</sup></code> in a polynomial.

Let `A(x)` and `B(x)` be the polynomials represented by `poly1` and `poly2`, respectively.

Return an integer array `result` representing the coefficients of the product polynomial `R(x) = A(x) * B(x)`, where `result[i]` denotes the coefficient of <code>x<sup>i</sup></code> in `R(x)`.
