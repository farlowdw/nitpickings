You are given two integer arrays, `skill` and `mana`, of length `n` and `m`, respectively.

In a laboratory, `n` wizards must brew `m` potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity `mana[j]` and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the `i`th wizard on the `j`th potion is <code>time<sub>ij</sub> = skill[i] * mana[j]</code>.

Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.
