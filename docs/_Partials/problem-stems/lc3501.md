You are given a binary string `s` of length `n`, where:

- `'1'` represents an active section.
- `'0'` represents an inactive section.

You can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in `s`. In a trade, you:

- Convert a contiguous block of `'1'`s that is surrounded by `'0'`s to all `'0'`s.
- Afterward, convert a contiguous block of `'0'`s that is surrounded by `'1'`s to all `'1'`s.

Additionally, you are given a 2D array queries, where <code>queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a substring <code>s[l<sub>i</sub>...r<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

For each query, determine the maximum possible number of active sections in `s` after making the optimal trade on the substring <code>s[l<sub>i</sub>...r<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

Return an array answer, where `answer[i]` is the result for `queries[i]`.

**Note**

- For each query, treat <code>s[l<sub>i</sub>...r<sub>i</sub>]</code> as if it is augmented with a `'1'` at both ends, forming <code>t = '1' + s[l<sub>i</sub>...r<sub>i</sub>] + '1'</code>. The augmented <code>'1'</code>s do not contribute to the final count.
- The queries are independent of each other.
