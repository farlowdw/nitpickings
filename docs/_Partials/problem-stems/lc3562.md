You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from `1` to `n`, and employee `1` is the CEO. You are given two 1-based integer arrays, `present` and `future`, each of length `n`, where:

- `present[i]` represents the current price at which the `i`th employee can buy a stock today.
- `future[i]` represents the expected price at which the `i`th employee can sell the stock tomorrow.

The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array `hierarchy`, where <code>hierarchy[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that employee <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> is the direct boss of employee <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.

Additionally, you have an integer `budget` representing the total funds available for investment.

However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock, then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price (`floor(present[v] / 2)`).

Return the maximum profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget.

Note:

- You may buy each stock at most once.
- You cannot use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from `budget`.
