You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers, `x` and `k`. You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

Increase or decrease any element of `nums` by `1`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to have at least `k` non-overlapping subarrays of size exactly `x` in `nums`, where all elements within each subarray are equal.
