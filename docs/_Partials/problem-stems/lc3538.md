You are given a straight road of length `l` km, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and two integer arrays, `position` and `time`, each of length `n`.

The array `position` lists the positions (in km) of signs in strictly increasing order (with `position[0] = 0` and `position[n - 1] = l`).

Each `time[i]` represents the time (in minutes) required to travel 1 km between `position[i]` and `position[i + 1]`.

You must perform exactly `k` merge operations. In one merge, you can choose any two adjacent signs at indices `i` and `i + 1` (with `i > 0` and `i + 1 < n`) and:

- Update the sign at index `i + 1` so that its time becomes `time[i] + time[i + 1]`.
- Remove the sign at index `i`.

Return the minimum total travel time (in minutes) to travel from `0` to `l` after exactly `k` merges.
