You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`. You are also given a 2D array `queries`, where <code>queries[i] = [index<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>, start<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>i</sub>]</code>.

You are allowed to perform an operation once on `nums`, where you can remove any suffix from `nums` such that `nums` remains non-empty.

The x-value of `nums` for a given `x` is defined as the number of ways to perform this operation so that the product of the remaining elements leaves a remainder of `x` modulo `k`.

For each query in `queries` you need to determine the x-value of `nums` for <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> after performing the following actions:

- Update <code>nums[index<sub>i</sub>]</code> to <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>. Only this step persists for the rest of the queries.
- Remove the prefix <code>nums[0..(start<sub>i</sub> - 1)]</code> (where <code>nums[0..(-1)]</code> will be used to represent the empty prefix).

Return an array `result` of size `queries.length` where `result[i]` is the answer for the `i`th query.

A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

A suffix of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array.

Note that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be empty.

Note that x-value has a different definition in this version.
