You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

A permutation of `nums` is said to form a divisible concatenation if, when you concatenate the decimal representations of the numbers in the order specified by the permutation, the resulting number is divisible by `k`.

Return the lexicographically smallest permutation (when considered as a list of integers) that forms a divisible concatenation. If no such permutation exists, return an empty list.
