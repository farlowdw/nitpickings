You are given two integers, `m` and `k`, and an integer array `nums`.

A sequence of integers `seq` is called magical if:

- `seq` has a size of `m`.
- `0 <= seq[i] < nums.length`
- The binary representation of <code>2<sup>seq[0]</sup> + 2<sup>seq[1]</sup> + ... + 2<sup>seq[m - 1]</sup></code> has `k` set bits.

The array product of this sequence is defined as `prod(seq) = (nums[seq[0]] * nums[seq[1]] * ... * nums[seq[m - 1]])`.

Return the sum of the array products for all valid magical sequences.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.

A set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of 1.
