You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

You must repeatedly perform the following operation while the string `s` has at least two consecutive characters:

- Remove the leftmost pair of adjacent characters in the string that are consecutive in the alphabet, in either order (e.g., `'a'` and `'b'`, or `'b'` and `'a'`).
- Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the resulting string after no more operations can be performed.

**Note:** Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` and `'z'` are consecutive.
