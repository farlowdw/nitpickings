You are given an array `nums` of size `n`, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become `0`.

In one operation, you can select a subarray `[i, j]` (where `0 <= i <= j < n`) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array `0`.
