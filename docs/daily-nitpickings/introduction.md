Even if we accept that *curiosity* (in whatever form) is the engine of productivity in most human endeavors, specifically software engineering, then we still need to be cautious. Why? Because the sheer volume of things to learn in software engineering can be overwhelming to the point of paralysis. Sometimes I find it helpful to remind myself of something I used to say when studying mathematics

*Mathematics is not about understanding more. It is about misunderstanding less.*

I like to think that this applies to software engineering as well. Don't try to learn everything. You can't. It's a fool's errand. But, day by day, you should hopefully be able to point to *something* you misunderstand just a little bit less &#8212; this is the inspiration behind these "daily nitpickings" as well as my "[Nit Wits](/blog)" blog. I have worked hard to break into the software industry, something I have now been paid to do for a couple of years, but I have much more "breaking" and "misunderstanding less" to do.

Over time, I plan to highlight notable daily nitpickings on this page. For now, check out [year 2025](docs/daily-nitpickings/year-2025) to see where things are!
